# oneStroke

Use *oneStroke drawing*, to draw a portrait. 

## Description

All the implementations are in `foo.py` (don't have a better name). And `GLHF/` is a folder contain a jupyter notebook that will help you get a better feeling of this implementation. 

Hmmm, `__main__.py` is untested, so don't panic if there are **TONS** of error.

Unfortunately this implementation does not find a Euler path, even if the graph is somehow Eulerian graph. (by somehow I mean almost impossible, unless magic) 

## Dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Basically, it's just `jupyter`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`. Not too many dependencies. Actually, `jupyter` and `matplotlib` is optional if you don't want to dive in `GLHF/`.

## Last but not the least
Good Luck Have Fun :)
